This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm install

npm run dev



```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You will need to register for an account and sign in to access any of the pages.

This web app uses Firebase auth, so passwords are not stored in Firestore.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
